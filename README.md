## Problem Statement
### Challenge:
Mental health issues and lifestyle management are critical areas that impact overall well-being. Many individuals struggle with maintaining mental health, managing stress, setting and achieving personal goals, and maintaining a balanced lifestyle.

6. **Crisis Detection**
   - The AI can detect if you're in a crisis (e.g., "I want to hurt myself") and provide support.

7. **Language Detection**
   - The AI can detect the language of your input (e.g., English, Spanish) and respond in the same language.

8. **Integration with Wearables and Smart Devices**
   - Health Monitoring: Integrates with wearable devices to monitor physical health metrics like heart rate and sleep patterns.
   - Smart Home Integration: Controls smart home devices to create a calming environment (e.g., adjust lighting, play calming music).

## General AI Functionality
The General AI component of LifeCoach AI is designed to handle everyday tasks and provide general assistance. It uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Voice Recognition to understand and execute user commands. Below is a breakdown of how it works:

1. **Voice Recognition and Text-to-Speech**
   - **Voice Recognition:** The system captures voice input from the user and converts it into text using Google Cloud Speech-to-Text. This allows the AI to understand commands in multiple languages.
   - **Text-to-Speech:** The AI’s responses are converted from text to speech using Google Cloud Text-to-Speech, enabling the assistant to "speak" back to the user.

2. **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**
   The AI uses spaCy or transformers (like Hugging Face models) to process and understand user commands. This includes:
   - **Intent Detection:** Identifying what the user wants (e.g., opening an app, searching the web, or playing music).
   - **Entity Recognition:** Extracting specific details from the command (e.g., the name of a song or a search query).
   - **Language Detection:** Automatically detecting the language of the user’s input and responding in the same language.

3. **Command Processing**
   The AI has a Command Router that directs user commands to the appropriate module. For example:
   - If the user says, "Open Spotify," the command is routed to the General Assistance Module.
   - If the user says, "I feel stressed," the command is routed to the Mental Health Support Module.

4. **General Assistance Module**
   This module handles everyday tasks and general queries. Here’s how it works:
   - **Supported Commands**
     - **Greet the AI:** Command: "Hello", "Hi", or "Hey". Response: The AI greets the user back (e.g., "Hello! How can I help you today?").
     - **Exit the AI:** Command: "Bye", "Exit", or "Goodbye". Response: The AI says goodbye and stops the session (e.g., "Goodbye! Have a great day!").
     - **Get the Current Time:** Command: "What’s the time?" or "Tell me the time". Response: The AI fetches the current time and responds (e.g., "The current time is 3:45 PM.").
     - **Open Applications:** Command: "Open [application name]" (e.g., "Open Notepad", "Open Spotify"). Response: The AI launches the specified application on the user’s device.
     - **Search Google:** Command: "Search Google for [query]" (e.g., "Search Google for AI trends"). Response: The AI performs a Google search and provides a summary or opens the search results in a browser.
     - **Search Wikipedia:** Command: "Search Wiki [query]" (e.g., "Search Wiki Albert Einstein"). Response: The AI fetches a summary from Wikipedia and reads it aloud.
     - **Play Songs on YouTube:** Command: "Play [song name] on YouTube" (e.g., "Play Shape of You on YouTube"). Response: The AI opens YouTube and plays the requested song or video.

5. **Example Workflow for General AI**
   - **User Interaction:** The user says, "Play Bohemian Rhapsody on YouTube."
   - **Voice Recognition:** The voice input is captured and converted to text: "Play Bohemian Rhapsody on YouTube."
   - **NLP Processing:** The AI detects the intent (play a song) and extracts the entity (Bohemian Rhapsody).
   - **Command Routing:** The command is routed to the General Assistance Module.
   - **Task Execution:** The AI opens YouTube and searches for "Bohemian Rhapsody."
   - **Response Generation:** The AI responds, "Playing Bohemian Rhapsody on YouTube."
   - **Text-to-Speech Conversion:** The response is converted to speech and played back to the user.

6. **Integration with Other Modules**
   The General AI functionality is seamlessly integrated with other modules like Mental Health Support and Life Coaching. For example:
   - If the user says, "I feel stressed," the AI can suggest a guided meditation session (Mental Health Support) or play calming music (General Assistance).
   - If the user says, "Set a goal to exercise daily," the AI can create a goal (Life Coaching) and set reminders (General Assistance).

7. **Technical Implementation**
   - **Voice Recognition:** Google Cloud Speech-to-Text API.
   - **Text-to-Speech:** Google Cloud Text-to-Speech API.
   - **NLP:** spaCy or Hugging Face transformers for intent detection and entity recognition.
   - **Command Execution:**
     - For opening apps: System-level commands (e.g., os.system in Python).
     - For web searches: Google Search API or web scraping.
     - For YouTube: YouTube Data API or direct URL opening.
